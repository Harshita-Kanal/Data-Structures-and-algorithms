### PRIM'S ALGORITHM

I found Prim's Algorithm to be most intriguing because it was the first algorithm which was taught to me in DSA.

It is used to find Maximum Spanning Tree and the shortest distance from the starting vertex.

It uses Priority Queues to find MST.

In it, starting vertex is given to us to find MST.

Lastly, it has only one subtree and in iteration, a vertex and an edge is added to it.



Time complexity: O((V+E)(log V))
 
V:Vertex of Graph
E:Edge of Graph
